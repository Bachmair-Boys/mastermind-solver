			<h1>Mastermind Solver</h1>
			<p>Mastermind is a code-breaking game in which one player tries to guess the code their opponent comes up with. The object is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs. Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the code. The winner is the player who solves his opponent's secret code with fewer guesses. A black Key Peg to indicate a Code Peg of the right color and in the right position (without indication of which Code Peg it corresponds to). A white Key Peg to indicate a Code Peg of the right color but in the wrong position. No Key Peg to indicate a wrong color that does not appear in the secret code.</p>
